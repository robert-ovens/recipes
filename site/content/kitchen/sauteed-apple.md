draft: false
serves: 1
preparation-time: 5 minutes
cooking-time: 10 minutes
ingredients:
  - 2 apple peeled, cored and diced
  - 2 tbs butter
  - 1 tbs brown sugar
  - vanila pod halved and scraped for the seeds
method:
  - In a medium hot pan add the butter and sugar
  - As soon as it is melted add the apples vanilla seeds and the pods.
  - Give it a stir and then leave it alone for a bit. If you fuss with it you won't caramelize the sugar onto the apple pieces.
  - Give the apple pieces a couple of turns during the cooking period until you get a nice deep caramel colour on the apples.
notes: One of the most satisfying desserts to make, it also goes really well on porridge. Or pancakes. Or pork chops. Or more sauteed apples.

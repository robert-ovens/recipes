A basic tomato sauce recipe that can be used for pizza, pasta or a base for a jus or other sauce. I usually make double or triple the quantity below and freeze whatever is leftover.

### Ingredients

* 400g can of tomatoes. Pulped is better, and Italian tomatoes are better still.
* 1 tbsp olive oil.
* 1 clove of garic, crushed.
* 1/2 tsp of salt.
* A good grind of black pepper.
* a shake of hot sauce (optional).
* 1/2 tsp of sugar.

### Method

1. In a saucepan on medium, sweat the garlic until a pleasant aroma starts. Do not let it brown.
1. Add tomatoes and cook for 10 minutes or so. The sugo will thicken slightly and start to become glossy.
1. Taste and add salt, pepper, sugar and hot sauce accordingly. If the tomatoes are lacking sweetness add some sugar. However this may be unecessary - it just depends on the quality of the tomatoes.
1. Cook for another 20-30 minutes on low. The more time you give it the more it will intensify.
